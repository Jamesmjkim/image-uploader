<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./Demo/Demo_screen.png)

This is the interface you will see when loading the page. From here you will be able to upload photos and see previous uploaded files. As my first project, I learned a lot about frontend css and how to position containers. Also, learning how to implement bootstrap in react. Coding out the entire full-stack app gave me exposure to knowing how to approach website creation and implementing features that require both the frontend and backend.
